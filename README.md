# State of Shopping

This is a React App that showcases how to use React Zustand efficiently for state management. The application demonstrates best practices for organizing store structure, implementing actions, and consuming state across components. It includes examples of complex state interactions and performance optimizations.

By the end of this code-along, you will be able to:

- Set up and configure a Zustand store
- Manage complex state with Zustand
- Implement staet actions and selectors
- Use Zustand with React components
- Implement persistence with Zustand middleware
